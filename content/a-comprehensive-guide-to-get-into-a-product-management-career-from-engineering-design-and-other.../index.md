“How do I get into a product management career?” —  the most frequent question I get asked from my friends who are from Engineering or Design background and aspire to become a Product Manager. Last weekend a friend visited me to seek guidance on this topic and asked me to write a post so she and others could refer it later.

Obviously many people have already written on this topic and shared some great advice, but I couldn’t find a single resource which was comprehensive enough so that aspiring people could just refer it as a guide. So I decided to give it a try to make this post as comprehensive as possible. So please bear with me as it’s a quite long post.
